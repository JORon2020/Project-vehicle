Project Summary: Vehicle Number Plate Recognition System

The Vehicle Number Plate Recognition System is a computer vision-based project designed 
to automatically detect and recognize vehicle license plates using image processing and 
machine learning techniques. The system captures an image or video frame of a vehicle, 
identifies the number plate region, extracts the characters from the plate using Optical 
Character Recognition (OCR), and then converts them into readable text.

This system is useful in automating tasks such as vehicle tracking, law enforcement, toll collection, 
and parking management. By integrating technologies like OpenCV for image processing and machine 
learning models for character recognition, the system provides a fast, efficient, and contactless way 
to identify vehicles. It can be deployed in real-time scenarios such as at security gates, highways, or 
traffic signals to enhance surveillance and traffic regulation.
